  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
    <li>I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.</li>
    {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
      <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
    }
  </ul>
  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
